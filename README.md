# WinTeaTimer

This little tool locks your workstation after a defined time has elapsed so you never forget to have your tea while concentrated on coding ;-)

Qt5, CMake, Visual Studio >= 2019 and the Windows SDK are required to build the software on Windows. It might also work with MinGW, clang or icc; never tried it.
A Linux port is currently work in progress.
