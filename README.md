# WinTeaTimer

This little tool locks your Windows workstation after a defined time has elapsed so you never forget to have your tea while concentrated on coding ;-)

Qt5, CMake, Visual Studio >= 2019 and the Windows SDK are required to build the software. It might also work with MinGW; never tried it.
