# TeaTimer

This little tool locks your workstation after a defined time has elapsed so you never forget to have your tea while concentrated on coding ;-)

On Windows Qt5, CMake, Visual Studio >= 2019 and the Windows SDK are required to build the software. It might also work with MinGW, clang or icc; never tried it.
On Linux Qt5, CMake and gcc are required. It will probably also work with clang.
